# Any problem you faced while coding this : No


# Your code here along with comments explaining your approach
# 1. In curr_interval, I am trying to get closest to the end index
# 2. In next_interval, holds the maximum next interval for indexes within the current_interval
#   In other words, after taking the  jump where is my next interval
